## Design

Work in progress (update to follow)

### User Research

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QRDLhk5AxV7O4sHdwEFu3Qr7k0PTvkJDEbNzNs7dYHg/edit#gid=1136481220">User Research Document</a>

User research is the first step of the UX design process, which focuses on understanding user behaviours, needs, and motivations through observation
techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies. Firstly, we created a survey with a set of questions related to our application.
As a result, we got approximately 50 responses from the people residing in North Bay and also outside of North Bay.
These results helped us to know the goals, frustrations and suggestions.

### Product Research

This research will evaluate how a product might fit into the market and learn the desired characteristics. It allows companies
to understand what the customers really want and what is likely to succeed in the market using available technology.
We researched products which are similar to our product. This research helped us to find the new features which can be
implemented in our application.

### Personas

Persona represents a unique group of people who share common goals and needs. After the user research, we 
synthesize the responses considering the goals and frustrations of the people. We created three primary users 
and one secondary user.

### User Stories & Usage Scenarios

Scenarios describe the stories and context behind why a specific user or user group uses our product. They note the goals and questions 
to be achieved and sometimes define how the user(s) can complete them with the product. We have created six scenarios for primary users 
and one for secondary users. These scenarios helped us to navigate to the next level, which is Information Architecture.

### Information Architecture

It focuses on organizing, structuring, and labelling content effectively and sustainably. The goal is to help users find 
information and complete tasks. Firstly, we created a basic layout for information architecture considering the goals of 
the users. Later, we improvised the information architecture several times to get a flawless design.

### Paper Prototypes

Paper prototyping is a process where we create a paper representation of the application to realize the concepts and test designs.
We drew sketches and used them to cheaply guide the designs and study users’ reactions early in this project.
