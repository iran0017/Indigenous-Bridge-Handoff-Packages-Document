## Design

Work in progress (update to follow)

### User Research

<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QRDLhk5AxV7O4sHdwEFu3Qr7k0PTvkJDEbNzNs7dYHg/edit#gid=1136481220">User Research Document</a>

User research is the first step of the UX design process, which focuses on understanding user behaviours, needs, and motivations through observation
techniques, task analysis, and other feedback methodologies. Firstly, we created a survey with a set of questions related to our application.
As a result, we got approximately 50 responses from the people residing in North Bay and also outside of North Bay.
These results helped us to know the goals, frustrations and suggestions.

### Product Research

This research will evaluate how a product might fit into the market and learn the desired characteristics. It allows companies
to understand what the customers really want and what is likely to succeed in the market using available technology.
We researched products which are similar to our product. This research helped us to find the new features which can be
implemented in our application.

<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cyIoFJ-PAV_H0oTVj3abhuoSI_VQRAzzBIpcAF3HM8k/edit">Product Research Document</a>

### Personas

Persona represents a unique group of people who share common goals and needs. After the user research, we 
synthesize the responses considering the goals and frustrations of the people. We created three primary users 
and one secondary user.

### User Stories & Usage Scenarios

Scenarios describe the stories and context behind why a specific user or user group uses our product. They note the goals and questions 
to be achieved and sometimes define how the user(s) can complete them with the product. We have created six scenarios for primary users 
and one for secondary users. These scenarios helped us to navigate to the next level, which is Information Architecture.

### Information Architecture

It focuses on organizing, structuring, and labelling content effectively and sustainably. The goal is to help users find 
information and complete tasks. Firstly, we created a basic layout for information architecture considering the goals of 
the users. Later, we improvised the information architecture several times to get a flawless design.

### Paper Prototypes

Paper prototyping is a process where we create a paper representation of the application to realize the concepts and test designs.
We drew sketches and used them to cheaply guide the designs and study users’ reactions early in this project.

<!-- Technical Research -->

## Technical Research

The team has researched technologies of building front-end, backend. Generally:
- We build mainly the App by React Native.
- We build the dashboard by React JS, Core UI, and React Redux.
- We build the backend by NodeJS, Express.
- We build the database by MongoDb and install in Virtual Machine EC2 of AWS.
- We deploy the backend in AWS.
- We follow the design guideline of Apple Human Guideline.
- We use AWS - S3 to store media: images/ video.

<!-- Getting Started -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Get a API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```

3. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

4. Enter your API in `config.js`

```JS
const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_


<!-- Backend-->

## Backend
The backend is now running on VM EC2 in AWS. You can see the source code **ONLY in the AWS** due to the security of the backend and database.

## Access to the the backend running on Virtual Machine EC2 in AWS:
1. Open Terminal
2. Download [server_key.pem](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x8_nODA5_C6YtPSmfXrJPGeOodMLCM8h) to access to the VM.
3. Navigate to the key location:
```
cd [key directory]
```
4. [Sign in](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.aws.amazon.com%2Fconsole%2Fhome%3Fnc2%3Dh_ct%26src%3Dheader-signin%26state%3DhashArgs%2523%26isauthcode%3Dtrue&client_id=arn%3Aaws%3Aiam%3A%3A015428540659%3Auser%2Fhomepage&forceMobileApp=0&code_challenge=KEVVSl29P-PpwanhslNx0twaq92N5Y2fhSB3EuBL8NQ&code_challenge_method=SHA-256) to AWS with your credentials.

5. Navigate to EC2 -> Instances Running -> Check the box of NBIFC_server machine -> Connect -> SSH Client.
6. Run those command line in step 3 and 4. Now you are remoting the Virtual Machine EC2.
7. Go to the backend directory:
```sh
cd indigenous-hyperdev-backend/
```
![Virtual Machine](images/Virtual_Machine.png)

This is the folder of backend source code. 

8. Re-deploy the backend by Docker after modification.
```sh
docker build --tag=indigenous:latest .

docker-compose up -d
```

9. Delete the docker images if needed.
```sh
docker images

docker image rm --force [image Id]
```
You can also see the source code, or download it to your computer in [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x8_nODA5_C6YtPSmfXrJPGeOodMLCM8h)
